# sing up / sing in

This is a Sing up/Sing in form, with no graphics. Data stored in MySQL database. The storage of the passwords is done with md5 hashing.

When you sing up, you have to give a Username, Name, Last Name, Email and Password. You have to write the password two times and it has to be six characters long at least. The email has to be unique and it has to have an "@" symbol, if it doesen't, you can't sing up.

On log in, you have to enter your email and password. If it's not correct you can't log in to your account. Whenever you are logged in you can read or change a text. When you create an account, you get a default text, then when you log in you can change it.

The point of this project is to practice getting and sending information in a database.
